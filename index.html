            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I first learned how to code in college (circa 2011) with C++ and Alice (an object-based programming language) but lost touch after graduation. I resumed coding again in Fall 2018 at the University of Redlands Coding Bootcamp Program. The program primarily focused on full-stack web development and I completed it in December 2018. I am currently doing freelancing work, working full-time at the hospital as Hemodialysis Technician, and attending Crafton Hills College to expand my knowledge in the field.</p>

            <h4>Crafton Hills College</h4>
            <p style="color:gray">December 2019 - May 2020</p>
            <p>Worked with a mentor and was assigned to a client that worked for the city of Mentone in California. Worked on the client's webpage, a new article site through a CMS known as WordPress. I did mostly front-end work: design, maintenance, and modifications to webpage. Also helped client on how to do the basics of working with WordPress. </p>

            <p style="color:gray">April 2019 - October 2019</p>
            <p>I was hired by this business as a web developer. I had redesigned the entire webpage through WordPress. Added some missing links such as rewards and an interactive image gallery. Most of the front-end design was written in HTML and CSS. </p>
